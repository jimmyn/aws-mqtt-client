# AWS Websocket Pub/Sub client

[AWS MQTT](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html) Websocket Pub/Sub with AWS IoT based on [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js).
Recently [AWS released support of WebSockets for IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/01/aws-iot-now-supports-websockets-custom-keepalive-intervals-and-enhanced-console/) service. It is very easy to use as Pub/Sub message system for serverless web applications. You can post new messages from `AWS lambda function` via `http post request` and receive them as websocket messages on client.

## Installing it

````bash
npm install aws-mqtt-client --save
````

## Basic usage

1.  Create an IAM role and asign predefined `AWSIoTDataAccess` policy. (It is better to use [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to provide temporary credentials for the front-end application, you can also customize policy to allow access only to user specific topics).
2.  Run AWS CLI command `aws iot describe-endpoint` to get IoT endpoint url.
3.  Create `mqttClient` with AWS credentials.
````js
const AWSMqtt = require("aws-mqtt-client").default
const mqttClient = new AWSMqtt({
	accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
	secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
	sessionToken: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN,
	endpointAddress: AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT_HOST,
	region: 'us-east-1'
});
````
4.  Connect and receive messages from your topic.
````js
mqttClient.on('connect', () => {
	mqttClient.subscribe('test-topic');
	console.log('connected to iot mqtt websocket');
});
mqttClient.on('message', (topic, message) => {
	console.log(message.toString());
});
````
5.  Publish a message.
````js
mqttClient.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, message);
````
